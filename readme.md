# 1:1 hipfire ads sense

This little programm is used to get a 1 to 1 hipfire ads mouse sensitivity ratio in any shooter

The Mouse starts moving at point A, stops at point B, presses the right mouse button (ads) and moves back to point A.
The goal is to keep changing the ingame ads sensitivity until the first point A lines up with the second point A.

Connect a switch of your choice to GND and pin 9

Used controller: arduino micro pro
